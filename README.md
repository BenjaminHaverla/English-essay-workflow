# English essay about the word AWESOME

My name is Benjamín Haverla, and I live in Martin, Slovakia. I studied Information and Digital Technologies at [Private Secondary Technical School](https://ssosta.edupage.org) in Poprad, founded by the Tatra Academy n. o. Currently, I am studying at the [University of Creative Communication](https://www.vskk.cz/cz/) in Prague. I specialize in the Design Motion Copy department, which focuses on Animation and VFX.

Of course, this is just small piece of my [personality](https://github.com/BenjaminHaverla/Main-about-me.git), and I strongly believe that what is on paper does not fully describe me what I am capable of. Maybe I can share my whole story some other time. For now, I would like to share one piece of my experience, starting with the word:
